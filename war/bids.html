                        August 2013. The choice of data is strange. First, the data covers
                        only 6 bidding exercises (out of 24 in a year) and a short time
                        frame (3 months). Second, the data is timed <em>after</em> the car loan

                        is greater variance. Bidders could also afford to bid more.

                        In a bid to reassure the public that overbidding
                        is not a cause of the high COE prices, Transport Minister Lui Tuck
                        Yew said that <a href="//www.todayonline.com/singapore/current-coe-system-does-not-lead-aggressive-bidding"

                        Among car COEs, overbidding seems to be more
                        pronounced in Category B (premium cars) and Category E (open). Contrary to the official
                        account, these two categories see slightly <strong>more than 10 percent of successful
                        bids exceeding the QP by 10 percent or more</strong>. Perhaps this
                        observation is not surprising; bidders for these two categories
                        should have a higher propensity to spend.

                    <p class="essay">
                        Other questions remain. For the bids that exceed
                        the QP by 10 percent or more, how many are car dealers? How
                        different would the data be over a longer time period and/or before
                        the car loan restrictions imposed in February 2013?

                            href="//www.todayonline.com/singapore/current-coe-system-does-not-lead-aggressive-bidding"
                            target="_blank">little incentive</a> to overbid for COEs as it
                            would erode their profit margins. But is this really true? At first
                            glance, this might seem the case as dealers do provide hedging
                            against rising COE prices in the future. Dealers offer to transact
                            at <em>current</em> COE prices instead of the actual price when the
                            COE is acquired. Should the COE price increase, the dealers make up
                            the difference.
                        </p>

                        <p class="essay">
                            The current auction system makes sense when the
                            COE price represents a true cost to every bidder. But bear in mind
                            that dealers are agents, not principals, and their goal is profit
                            maximising. COE prices are effectively passed on to consumers, with
                            the hedge against rising COE prices added on as a deal sweetener.
                            Even if COE prices should rise against the dealer’s favour and the
                            profit margin of the current deal takes a haircut, the dealer makes
                            up for it by <strong>closing the <em>next</em> deal at an even higher price</strong>.

                            total price of the car, which includes the COE. They have every
                            incentive to jack up the total price of the car by overbidding on
                            the COE and raising COE prices. This is especially true in the current
                            climate of historically low COE quotas, which place a hard limit on
                            the number of cars they can sell. While dealers couldn’t sell as
                            many physical cars as before, they could manipulate COE prices to a
                            point where the piece of paper is worth a number of times more than
                            the car!

                            As Mr Tan Si An has rightly pointed out in a forum letter, “the
                            COE system introduces a lot of distortion into the final price of
                            a car. COE premiums can range from more than 10 times the OMV of
                            low-end models to less than 10 per cent for a high-end vehicle.”

                            corresponding COE premium from the second bidding exercise of
                            September 2013 amounted to $83,751, which is more than 4x the value
                            of the car. Altogether, the consumer pays for 5 cars (OMV + COE).
                            Imagine, in a single deal, the middleman earns commission for the equivalent of 5

                            And so the feast continues, riding on a
                            “famine” of COE quotas in recent years. With COE quotas in short
                            supply, dealers help themselves to the lion’s share by crowding out
                            individual bidders with their financial clout. Not only do dealers
                            have more cash on hand than the typical household, they also have
                            access to deeper credit lines from the banks. (Not to mention that banks
                            get referral business from dealers in the form of car loans!) In this way, dealers
                            exert <strong>considerable influence over COE prices when quotas are low</strong>.

                            So what can we do? Should we ban dealers from
                            bidding outright? Should we change the COE auction system from the
                            present Lowest-Successful-Bid (LSB) to Pay-As-You-Bid (PAYB)?

                            A ban on dealer bidding can be overcome by proxy. Some consumers do
                            value the convenience of dealers bidding on their behalf. An
                            outright ban doesn’t seem like such a good idea. It is also
                            debatable as to whether a PAYB auction can provide greater
                            efficiency and lower COE prices. However, the LTA can consider
                            lowering the barriers to entry by <strong>reducing the bid
                            deposit</strong>. This will encourage more individual bidding and reduce
                            the risk of collusion among dealers.
